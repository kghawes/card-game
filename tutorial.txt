When you are attacked, your Resistances and Weaknesses apply before your Defense does.

Status effects that activate at the beginning of your turn do so in the order they were originally applied.

Weapons, Armor, and Skills cost Stamina to play. Spells cost Magicka. Items cost nothing.

Consumable cards can normally only be played once per combat.

Strength, Endurance, Willpower, Weaknesses, and Resistances scale Damage and Defense by 20% per level (multiple levels are combined additively).

Agility and Intelligence increase your maximum resource by an amount equal to the status level.

Statuses decay by one level each turn.

Stamina and Magicka replenish between turns. Health replenishes between Quests.

Statuses are reset after each Encounter.
