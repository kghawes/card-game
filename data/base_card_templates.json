Define a card for each kind of weapon, for each material, a normal version and versions for each enchantment. I believe this should be 60 cards. Leave cost, physical damage, and value as 0, I will define these myself. Group cards first by weapon type, then by material, so for example all the glass claymores should be listed together.
