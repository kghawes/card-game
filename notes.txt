Game Mechanics

Card
Name
Type (Weapon, Armor, Spell, Item, Skill, Consumable, Conjured)
Weapons, Armor, and Skills cost stamina and are partly class-restricted (by Style, Material/Weight, and Specialization respectively)
  Weapons deal physical damage plus other effects
  Armor adds defense plus other effects
  Spells cost magicka and have various effects
  Items are free to play but may have downside effects, may be weak, or may be expensive/rare
  Consumables are free to play but can only be used once per combat encounter and may be expensive/rare
  Conjured cards (like a bound mace) cost stamina and last until used or the end of combat, after which they are permanently deleted
Cost (stamina or magicka)
  Modified cost (temporary)
Effects
  Imbued Effects (temporary)
Value (gold)

Weapon
Style (Long Blade, Blunt Weapon, Short Blade, Marksman, Staff)
  Fighter: can use Long Blade, Blunt Weapon
  Thief: can use Short Blade, Marksman
  Mage: can use Staff
Substyle
Long blade: longsword, claymore
Blunt weapon: mace, warhammer
Short blade: dagger, shortsword
Marksman: throwing star, bow
(Staff: none)

Armor
Weight (Light, Medium or Heavy)
Fighter: can use Medium or Heavy
Thief: can use Light or Medium
Mage: can use none

Spells
School
  Alteration
   Defense for mages
   Own hand control (draw and cost reduction)
   Synergy with illusion for big power plays
  Conjuration
   Alternative to destruction/provides physical type damage for mages
  Destruction
   Damage and debuff
  Illusion
   Opponent interaction
  Mysticism
   Unusual or combat-ending effects
  Restoration
   Restore and buff
   Sundry synergies using situational buffs
All classes can use spells, but mages get the best starting magicka, their starting deck contains mostly spells where other classes have to find them, and mage skill cards that buff spells are mostly unavailable to other classes.

Skills
Specialization (Combat, Stealth, or Magic)
Out-of-class skills can be purchased and used but never appear as treasure rewards and may be difficult to find
Skills usually don’t deal damage or provide defense to avoid overlap with weapons and armor (which also cost stamina), but can overlap with spell effects since those cost magicka

Items
Cost nothing to play
Mundane items may be useless (merchant fodder) or provide minimal benefits
Enchanted items are rare and valuable, and will never have astoundingly good effects
Examples include clothing items, tools, books, and clutter

Consumables
Consumables cost nothing to play and go to a special “consumed” pile when played (and cannot be played again until next combat).
Potions
  Cheaper and less powerful than scrolls, with simpler effects
  Spoiled potions and liquors with drawback effects will be available in the early game, e.g. for when you need that extra bit of stamina to deal the killing blow and can afford to become more vulnerable
  Potions provide healing options for non-spellcasters
  Potion effects can be boosted by the alchemist status
Scrolls
  Later-game cards that have big one-time effects to change the course of combat
  Scroll effects can be boosted by the enchanter status

Comments and examples:
  If you apply poison 1 to the enemy during your turn, they take 1 poison damage at the start of their next turn, then poison is decremented to 0 and gets removed. If you were to apply poison 1 to yourself during your turn, it has no immediate effect and activates at the start of your next turn. If you apply fortify strength 1 to yourself, weapon cards you play this turn are more effective and the status will be removed before you can play cards on your next turn.
  Statuses that lower a number stack multiplicatively, while statuses that raise a number stack additively. This is to ensure the effects neither max out nor blow up in their effectiveness, but scale with status level.
  Statuses that lower a number should round that number down (floor), while statuses that raise a number should round that number up (ceiling).

Quests
A quest is a sequence of encounters. Health is maintained between encounters.
An encounter can be an enemy, a treasure, or an event.
Enemy encounters lead to combat.
Treasure encounters give the player rewards.
Events can have atmospheric descriptions or NPC dialogue, and can potentially involve some choices and consequences.
A quest ends with an enemy boss encounter. In the early game boss enemies are tougher regular enemies.
Eventually: different questlines per class (guild quests)

Combat
Combat is turn-based with the Player always going first.
Turn phases
  Start of Turn
    Handle status effects
    Replenish magicka and stamina to max
    Draw 6 cards for turn
  Main
    Play cards
  End of Turn
    Discard Hand
Enemy turns proceed similarly. Combat ends when one combatant reaches 0 health, or an intervention or recall effect resolves. If the player wins, they get treasure.

Treasure
Can contain gold, experience, and/or card rewards
Gold and card rewards should be partially random

Merchants
Merchants will buy cards at 80% value and sell cards at 120% value. Stock is possibly random.
Maybe have different merchants that sell different types of cards
Someday: disposition discount system?
