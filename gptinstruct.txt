Slay the Spire-Inspired Morrowind Fan Game Project
I'm developing a card game based in the setting of TES III: Morrowind with game mechanics inspired by Slay the Spire. The player starts as a new recruit of either the Fighters Guild, the Thieves Guild, or the Mages Guild (this determines the player's class and starting deck). Through a series of encounter-filled quests, the player acquires new cards and gains experience, becoming stronger. When defeated, the player receives a reward that will benefit future runs.

Genre: roguelike singleplayer deckbuilding card game
This is a personal project and not currently intended for release or publication.

Key Features:
Quests and rewards
Turn-based combat
Level system
Interacting status effects that decay over time
Everything is cards (no other items)
Dual stamina and magicka resource system
Cards and card effects inspired by Morrowind game mechanics (in addition to others)
Buying and selling cards

Working Title: JOURNEYS IN THE LAND OF ASH ("Land of Ash")

Game Mechanics Plan:

Cards
Card types
  Weapon: Costs stamina. Deals physical damage and can have other effects if enchanted.
  Armor: Costs stamina. Grants defense status and can have other effects if enchanted.
  Skill: Costs stamina. Can have a variety of effects, but not dealing physical damage or granting defense status.
  Spell: Costs magicka. Can have a wide variety of effects.
  Item: Costs nothing to play. Can have a wide variety of effects. Typically either very weak or enchanted and powerful but extremely rare.
  Consumables: Costs nothing to play. Can have a wide variety of effects. Consists of potions and scrolls. When played, the card is "consumed" (like "exhausted" cards in Slay the Spire)

Weapons
Style (Long Blade, Blunt Weapon, Short Blade, Marksman Weapon, Staff, Natural Weapon)
  Fighter: can use long blade, blunt weapon
  Thief: can use short blade, marksman weapon
  Mage: can use staff
  Only enemies can use natural weapons

Armor
Weight (Light, Medium, Heavy, or Natural)
  Fighter: can use medium or heavy
  Thief: can use light or medium
  Mage: can use none
  Only enemies can use natural armor

Spells
School
  Alteration
  Conjuration
  Destruction
  Illusion
  Mysticism
  Restoration
In general, many spells will be named the same as (and mechanically inspired by) a Morrowind spell, but they usually will not do the same thing as the Morrowind spell. There will also be spells inspired by mechanics in other card games that have nothing to do with Morrowind (like "scry").
All classes can use spells, but it will be balanced so that the Fighter can only ever use the most basic spells and none but the Mage can use late-game spells.

Skills
Specialization (Combat, Stealth, or Magic)
  Combat skills focus mainly on buffs.
  Stealth skills are more varied and include debuffs and other kinds of effects like draw and discard.
  Magic skills are few in number and focus on buffs.
Out-of-class skills can be purchased and used but never appear as treasure rewards and may be difficult to find.
Skills usually don’t deal damage or provide defense to avoid overlap with weapons and armor (which also cost stamina), but can overlap with spell effects since those cost magicka.

Items
Examples include clothing items, tools, books, and clutter
Unenchanted items can effects and usually buff. Their zero cost is balanced by not having strong effects.
Enchanted items can do anything a spell can do and for free - this is balanced by being very rare, hard to get cards.

Consumables
Consumables cost nothing to play and go to a special “consumed” pile when played (and cannot be played again until next combat).
They can do anything a spell can do.
Potions
  Cheaper and less powerful than scrolls, with simpler effects.
  Spoiled potions and liquors with drawback effects will be available in the early game, e.g. for when you need that extra bit of stamina to deal the killing blow and can afford to become more vulnerable for a turn.
  Potions provide healing options for non-spellcasters.
  Potion effects can be boosted by buffs.
Scrolls
  Later-game cards that have big one-time effects to change the course of combat, much like Slay the Spire's "exhaust" cards.

Generic cards
Except for enchantments, the following categories are just card variants and have no mechanical effect/are not represented programmatically.
Materials: iron, steel, orcish, adamantium, glass, ebony, daedric
Weapon Substyles: longsword, claymore, mace, warhammer, dagger, shortsword, throwing star, bow (staves have none)
Generic Enchantments: flame, shard, spark, viper, etc.
Armor Pieces: gauntlets, helm, boots, cuirass, shield
Item Fashions: common, expensive, extravagant, exquisite
Item Articles: gloves, hood, shoes, robe, belt, ring, amulet
Potion Qualities: bargain, cheap, standard, quality, exclusive
For example, you could have an ebony warhammer with the viper enchantment, or steel gauntlets, or an expensive robe. There are different versions of each other these.

Effects (subject to change)
X represents the level of the effect.
Deal damage of type (physical, fire, frost, shock, poison)
Apply status (to self or opponent)
Remove status (from self)
Restore stat (health, stamina, magicka)
  Increase stat by up to X, or to max.
Drain stat
  Decrease stat by up to X, or to 0.
  Your stamina and magicka can only be drained during your own turn.
  Health can only be lowered in relation to max health by taking damage. Drain health does a special "magic damage" type that is unaffected by any buffs or debuffs. It can still be blocked with defense. Note that taking damage is not exactly the same thing as the Effect "deal damage" which cannot deal magic damage.
Drain attribute (strength, endurance, intelligence, agility, speed, willpower, luck)
  Reduce or remove attribute status level X points.
Draw
  Max hand size is 12; further cards will not be drawn when the effect resolves.
Discard
  Select up to X cards to discard, or discard hand if you don't have enough.
Shield 
  Apply defense X.
Imbue effect
  Add an imbued effect to another card(s).
Jump
  Reduce the cost of your most costly card in hand by up to X (minimum 0). If there is a tie, just pick whichever card comes first.
Pickpocket
  Look at the top X cards in your opponent’s deck and pick one of them to play immediately as your own card (it goes to your opponent’s discard pile or consumed cards pile). Your opponent discards the rest.
Scry
  Look at the top X cards in your deck and pick one of them to add to your hand. Discard the rest.
Dispel
  Remove X levels from all of your active statuses.
Divine intervention
  Immediately end combat and return to town where quest can be retried (reduce gold by up to 100, or down to 0).
Almsivi intervention
  Immediately end combat and return to town where quest can be retried (reduce experience towards next level by up to 100, or down to 0).
Recall
  Immediately end combat and return to quest where enemy encounter can be retried.
Absorb health
  Reduce opponent health by up to X and restore your health by that much (opponent takes magic damage).

Statuses (subject to change)
Status decay: Decrement X by 1 each beginning of turn, or remove the status if X is zero.
Statuses go into effect immediately, but some may have immediate effects, others may trigger at each beginning of the turn, and others may trigger at specific times. For example, feather immediately makes cards in your hand less costly, poison deals damage at the start of each turn, and defense is triggered by an incoming attack.
Statuses can interact and should resolve their effects in the order in which the statuses were applied. This means for example that gaining the levitate status before gaining the burden status does something different from vice-versa. If levitate is applied last, the cards in your hand will all have the same value.
Defense
  Take up to X less damage from a card that would deal damage to you and if you do, remove levels of defense equal to the damage reduction.
Burden
  Your skills cost X more stamina.
Feather
  Your skills cost up to X less stamina (min 0 stamina).
Levitate
  For X turns, at the start of your turn the cost of each card in your hand is set to the average cost of all the cards in your hand (rounded up).
  Applies before or after other statuses that change cost depending on the order they were originally applied.
Locked 
  For X turns, the opponent cannot interact with your deck.
Waterwalking 
  For X turns, cards you play don’t get discarded.
  Doesn't apply to consumable or pickpocketed cards, nor any other card that would not go to your discard pile.
Waterbreathing 
  For X turns, cards you play that would be discarded go on top of your deck instead.
Swift Swim 
  For X turns, at the start of your turn, you may discard any number of cards then draw that many cards.
Poison 
  Take X poison damage each turn.
  Applies before or after other statuses that change health or max health depending on the order they were originally applied.

  Spells of this school cost up to X less magicka (min 0).
Fortify armor weight (light, medium, heavy) skill
  Armors of this weight cost up to X less stamina (min 0).
Fortify weapon style (long blade, blunt weapon, short blade, marksman weapon, staff) skill
  Weapons of this style cost up to X less stamina (min 0).
Silence 
  Cannot play spells for X turns.

Spell absorption
  When your opponent deals elemental damage to you, you take (0.8)^X times damage and you gain fortify intelligence equal to the number of points of damage blocked.
Alchemist 
  Your potions are 1+0.2X times as effective.
Examples:
  If you apply poison 1 to the enemy during your turn, they take 1 poison damage at the start of their next turn, then poison is decremented to 0 and gets removed. If you were to apply poison 1 to yourself during your turn, it has no immediate effect and activates at the start of your next turn just before being removed. If you apply fortify strength 1 to yourself, weapon cards you play this turn are more effective and the status will be removed before you can play cards on your next turn.

Player Character
Class
Level
  Upon level up, choose +1 to health, stamina, or magicka
  Don't record total experience, reset to 0 each level up
Deck
Library (card storage)

Game loop and progression
Start in Town
  Visit Merchants
  Adjust Deck and Library
  Talk to NPCs?
  Acquire Quest
Embark on Quest
  Encounter an Enemy, Event, or Treasure
  Repeat
Return to Town for Treasure
EVENTUALLY...
  Each time the player gets a game over, they can select one card in their deck to permanently add to a "class library" that all characters belonging to that class have access to. This way a really long and successful run gives you a big reward for next time, and a short run gives you a small reward.
  Building a class library to take on the final boss will be a major part of the game, even doing runs to acquire specific cards then getting a game over to quickly start looking for the next needed card. Maybe bosses that can only be faced once have a small chance of dropping an ultra-powerful card. These advancements will be necessary to get over periodic "walls" in the game's difficulty curve.

Quests
A quest is a sequence of encounters. Health is maintained between encounters but replenished between quests.
An encounter can be an enemy, a treasure, or an event.
Enemy encounters lead to combat.
Treasure encounters give the player rewards.
Events can have atmospheric descriptions or NPC dialogue, and can potentially involve some choices and consequences.
A quest ends with an enemy boss encounter. In the early game boss enemies are tougher regular enemies.

Combat
Combat is turn-based with the Player always going first.
Turn phases
  Start of Turn
    Handle status effects
    Replenish magicka and stamina to max
    Draw 6 cards for turn
  Main
    Play cards
  End of Turn
    Discard Hand
Enemy turns proceed similarly. Combat ends when one combatant reaches 0 health, or an intervention or recall effect resolves. If the player wins, they get treasure.
  Right now, enemies play cards from their hand at random. They will do this for the foreseeable future.

Enemies
Enemies have stats, a deck, and a loot table.
Quests have about 10 enemies and 1 boss enemy. Boss enemies may be regular enemies but with modified loot tables.

Treasure
Can contain gold, experience, and/or card rewards.
Gold and card rewards should be partially random.

Merchants
Merchants will buy cards at 80% value and sell cards at 120% value (or something). Stock is possibly partly random.
