Slay the Spire-Inspired Morrowind Fan Game Project
I'm developing a card game based in the setting of TES III: Morrowind with game mechanics inspired by Slay the Spire. The player starts as a new recruit of either the Fighters Guild, the Thieves Guild, or the Mages Guild (this determines the player's class and starting deck). Through a series of encounter-filled quests, the player acquires new cards and gains experience, becoming stronger. When defeated, the player receives a reward that will benefit future runs.

Genre: roguelike singleplayer deckbuilding card game
This is a personal project and not currently intended for release or publication.

Key Features:
Quests and rewards
Turn-based combat
Level system
Interacting status effects that decay over time
Everything is cards (no other items)
Dual stamina and magicka resource system
Cards and card effects inspired by Morrowind game mechanics (in addition to others)
Buying and selling cards

Working Title: JOURNEYS IN THE LAND OF ASH ("Land of Ash")

Game Mechanics Plan:

Cards
Card types
  Weapon: Costs stamina. Deals physical damage and can have other effects if enchanted.
  Armor: Costs stamina. Grants defense status and can have other effects if enchanted.
  Skill: Costs stamina. Can have a variety of effects, but not dealing physical damage or granting defense status.
  Spell: Costs magicka. Can have a wide variety of effects.
  Item: Costs nothing to play. Can have a wide variety of effects. Typically either very weak or enchanted and powerful but extremely rare.
  Consumables: Costs nothing to play. Can have a wide variety of effects. Consists of potions and scrolls. When played, the card is "consumed" (like "exhausted" cards in Slay the Spire)

Weapons
Style (Long Blade, Blunt Weapon, Short Blade, Marksman Weapon, Staff, Natural Weapon)
  Fighter: can use long blade, blunt weapon
    Fighters emphasize big damage through powerful and expensive individual weapons.
  Thief: can use short blade, marksman weapon
    Thieves emphasize low-cost weapons along with speed, evasion, hidden, draw, and floodgating.
  Mage: can use staff
    Mages have no access to physically powerful weapons and typically won't have the stamina to use weapons frequently, but staves have more interesting enchantments than other weapons making them more versatile.
  Only enemies can use natural weapons

Armor
Weight (Light, Medium, Heavy, or Natural)
  Fighter: can use medium or heavy
    Enables tank build.
  Thief: can use light or medium
    Low-cost way of prolonging combat.
  Mage: can use none
    Defense is acquired through spells.
  Only enemies can use natural armor

Spells
School
  Alteration
    Alteration spells focus on modifying card draw, card cost, and card power.
  Conjuration
    Behavior TBD.
  Destruction
    Destruction spells deal damage and apply combat debuffs.
  Illusion
    Illusion spells apply buffs and debuffs that are most useful to thieves.
  Mysticism
    Mysticism encompasses spells with unusual effects.
  Restoration
    Restoration spells replenish resources and apply combat buffs.
In general, many spells will be named the same as (and mechanically inspired by) a Morrowind spell, but they usually will not do the same thing as the Morrowind spell. There will also be spells inspired by mechanics in other card games that have nothing to do with Morrowind (like "scry").
All classes can use spells, but it will be balanced so that the Fighter can only ever use the most basic spells and none but the Mage can use late-game spells. This is partly enforced through the dual resource system.

Skills
Specialization (Combat, Stealth, or Magic)
  Combat skills focus mainly on buffs.
  Stealth skills are more varied and include debuffs and other kinds of effects like draw and discard.
  Magic skills are few in number and focus on buffs.
Out-of-class skills can be purchased and used but never appear as rewards and may be difficult to find.
Skills usually don’t deal damage or provide defense to avoid overlap with weapons and armor (which also cost stamina), but can overlap with spell effects since those cost magicka.

Items
Examples include clothing items, tools, books, and clutter
Unenchanted items can have effects and usually buff. Their zero cost is balanced by not having strong effects.
Enchanted items can do anything a spell can do and for free - this is balanced by being very rare, hard to get cards.

Consumables
Consumables cost nothing to play and go to a special “consumed” pile when played (and cannot be played again until next combat).
They can do anything a spell can do.
Potions
  Cheaper and less powerful than scrolls, with simpler effects.
  Spoiled potions and liquors with drawback effects will be available in the early game, e.g. for when you need that extra bit of stamina to deal the killing blow and can afford to become more vulnerable for a turn.
  Potions provide healing options for non-spellcasters.
  Potion effects can be boosted by buffs.
Scrolls
  Later-game cards that have big one-time effects to change the course of combat, much like Slay the Spire's "exhaust" cards.

Generic cards
Except for enchantments, the following categories are just card variants and have no mechanical effect/are not represented programmatically.
Weapon Materials: iron, steel, orcish, adamantium, glass, ebony, daedric
Weapon Substyles: longsword, claymore, mace, warhammer, dagger, shortsword, throwing star, bow (staves have none)
Generic Weapon Enchantments: flame, shard, spark, viper, etc.
Armor Materials: chitin, netch leather, glass, bonemold, orcish, adamantium, iron, steel, ebony, daedric
Armor Pieces: gauntlets, helm, boots, cuirass, shield
Item Tiers: common, expensive, extravagant, exquisite
Item Articles: gloves, hood, shoes, robe, belt, ring, amulet
Potion Qualities: bargain, cheap, standard, quality, exclusive
For example, you could have an ebony warhammer with the viper enchantment, or steel gauntlets, or an expensive robe. There are different versions of each of these.

Effects (subject to change)
X represents the level of the effect.
Deal damage of type (physical, fire, frost, shock, poison)
Apply status (to self or opponent)
Remove status (from self)
Restore stat (health, stamina, magicka)
  Increase stat by up to X, or to max.
Drain stat
  Decrease stat by up to X, or to 0.
  Your stamina and magicka can only be drained during your own turn.
  Health can only be lowered in relation to max health by taking damage. Drain health does a special "magic damage" type that is unaffected by any buffs or debuffs. It can still be blocked with defense. Note that taking damage is not exactly the same thing as the Effect "deal damage" which cannot deal magic damage.
Drain attribute (strength, endurance, intelligence, agility, speed, willpower, luck)
  Reduce or remove attribute status level X points.
Draw
  Max hand size is 12; further cards will not be drawn when the effect resolves.
Discard
  Select up to X cards to discard, or discard hand if you don't have enough.
Shield 
  Apply defense X.
Imbue effect
  Add an effect to another card(s).
Jump
  Reduce the cost of your most costly card in hand by up to X (minimum 0). If there is a tie, just pick whichever card comes first.
Pickpocket
  Look at the top X cards in your opponent’s deck and pick one of them to play immediately as your own card (it goes to your opponent’s discard pile or consumed cards pile). Your opponent discards the rest.
Prophecy (Scry)
  Look at the top X cards in your deck and pick one of them to add to your hand. Discard the rest.
Dispel
  Remove X levels from all of your active statuses.
Divine intervention
  Immediately end combat and return to town where quest can be retried (reduce gold by up to 100, or down to 0).
Almsivi intervention
  Immediately end combat and return to town where quest can be retried (reduce experience towards next level by up to 100, or down to 0).
Recall
  Immediately end combat and return to quest where enemy encounter can be retried.
Absorb health
  Reduce opponent health by up to X and restore your health by that much (opponent takes magic damage).

Statuses (subject to change)
Status decay: Decrement X by 1 each beginning of turn, or remove the status if X is zero.
Statuses go into effect immediately, but some may have immediate effects, others may trigger at each beginning of the turn, and others may trigger at specific times. For example, feather immediately makes cards in your hand less costly, poison deals damage at the start of each turn, and defense is triggered by an incoming attack.
Statuses can interact and should resolve their effects in the order in which the statuses were applied when statuses would resolve at the same time. This means for example that gaining the levitate status before gaining the burden status does something different from vice-versa. If levitate is applied last, the cards in your hand will all have the same value.
Defense
  Take up to X less damage from a card that would deal damage to you and if you do, remove levels of defense equal to the damage reduction.
Burden
  Your skills cost X more stamina.
Feather
  Your skills cost up to X less stamina (min 0 stamina).
Levitate
  For X turns, at the start of your turn the cost of each card in your hand is set to the average cost of all the cards in your hand (rounded up).
Locked 
  For X turns, the opponent cannot interact with your deck.
Waterwalking 
  For X turns, cards you play don’t get discarded.
  Doesn't apply to consumable or pickpocketed cards, nor any other card that would not go to your discard pile.
Waterbreathing 
  For X turns, cards you play that would be discarded go on top of your deck instead.
Swift Swim 
  For X turns, at the start of your turn, you may discard any number of cards then draw that many cards.
Poison 
  Take X poison damage each turn.
Weakness to damage type (physical, fire, frost, shock, poison) 
  Take 1+0.2x times damage from that type.
Resistance to damage type 
  Take 1-0.2x times damage from that type.
Damage strength 
  Your weapons do 1-0.2x times damage (minimum 1 damage).
Damage endurance 
  Your armor provides 1-0.2x times defense (min 0).
Damage intelligence 
  Reduce max magicka by up to X (min 0).
Damage agility 
  Reduce max stamina by up to X (min 0).
Damage speed 
  Draw up to X fewer cards each turn (draw 2 cards minimum).
Damage willpower 
  Your spells do 1-0.2x times damage (min 1 for spells that deal damage).

Immune to damage type 
  Take no damage from that type for X turns.
Fortify strength
  Your weapons do 1+0.2x times damage.
Fortify endurance
  Your armor provides 1+0.2x times defense.
Fortify intelligence 
  Max magicka +X.
Fortify agility 
  Max stamina +X.
Fortify speed 
  Draw X additional cards each turn.
Fortify willpower 
  Your spells deal 1+0.2X times damage.
Fortify luck 
  If you have this status at the end of combat, receive the maximum treasure rewards. Lasts X turns. If you have both fortify luck and damage luck active at the end of combat, receive normal awards.
Fortify magic school (alteration, conjuration, destruction, illusion, mysticism, restoration) skill
  Spells of this school cost up to X less magicka (min 0).
Fortify armor weight (light, medium, heavy) skill
  Armors of this weight cost up to X less stamina (min 0).
Fortify weapon style (long blade, blunt weapon, short blade, marksman weapon, staff) skill
  Weapons of this style cost up to X less stamina (min 0).
Silence 
  Cannot play spells for X turns.
Blind 
  Cannot play weapons for X turns.
Paralyze 
  Cannot play any card type except consumable cards for X turns.
Evasion 
  0.1X chance to take 0 damage whenever a card would deal damage to you.
Hidden 
  0.1X chance to skip the opponent’s next turn.
Frenzy 
  Cards you play have none of their effects except dealing damage for X turns.
Calm 
  Cards you play deal 0 damage for X turns.
Reflect 
  When your opponent deals elemental damage (fire, frost, shock) to you, you take 1-0.2X times damage and your opponent takes damage of the same type equal to the damage reduction.
Spell absorption
  When your opponent deals elemental damage to you, you take 1-0.2X times damage and you gain fortify intelligence equal to the number of points of damage blocked.
Alchemist 
  Your potions are 1+0.2X times as effective.
Examples:
  If you apply poison 1 to the enemy during your turn, they take 1 poison damage at the start of their next turn, then poison is decremented to 0 and gets removed. If you were to apply poison 1 to yourself during your turn, it has no immediate effect and activates at the start of your next turn just before being removed. If you apply fortify strength 1 to yourself, weapon cards you play this turn are more effective and the status will be removed before you can play cards on your next turn.

Player Character
Class
Level
  Upon level up, choose +1 to health, stamina, or magicka.
  Don't record total experience, reset to 0 each level up.
Deck
Library (card storage)

Game loop and progression
Start in Town
  Visit Merchants
  Adjust Deck and Library
  Talk to NPCs?
  Acquire Quest
Embark on Quest
  Encounter an Enemy, Event, or Treasure
  Repeat
Return to Town for Treasure
EVENTUALLY...
  Each time the player gets a game over, they can select one card in their deck to permanently add to a "class library" that all characters belonging to that class have access to. This way a really long and successful run gives you a big reward for next time, and a short run gives you a small reward.
  Building a class library to take on the final boss will be a major part of the game, even doing runs to acquire specific cards then getting a game over to quickly start looking for the next needed card. Maybe bosses that can only be faced once have a small chance of dropping an ultra-powerful card. These advancements will be necessary to get over periodic "walls" in the game's difficulty curve.

Quests
A quest is a sequence of encounters. Health is maintained between encounters but replenished between quests.
An encounter can be an enemy, a treasure, or an event.
Enemy encounters lead to combat.
Treasure encounters give the player rewards.
Events can have atmospheric descriptions or NPC dialogue, and can potentially involve some choices and consequences.
A quest ends with an enemy boss encounter. In the early game boss enemies are tougher regular enemies.

Combat
Combat is turn-based with the Player always going first.
Turn phases
  Start of Turn
    Replenish magicka and stamina to max
    Draw 6 cards for turn
  Main
    Play cards
  End of Turn
    Discard Hand
Enemy turns proceed similarly. Combat ends when one combatant reaches 0 health, or an intervention or recall effect resolves. If the player wins, they get rewards.
  Right now, enemies play cards from their hand at random. They will do this for the foreseeable future.

Enemies
Enemies have stats, a deck, and a loot table.
Quests have about 10 enemies and 1 boss enemy. Boss enemies may be regular enemies but with modified loot tables.

Rewards
Can contain gold, experience, and/or card rewards.
Gold and card rewards should be partially random.

Merchants
Merchants will buy cards at 80% value and sell cards at 120% value (or something). Stock is possibly partly random, possibly leveled, possibly class-specific, etc.

Key observations about gameplay
Class-based strategies
  With fighters having access to the best armor and weapon cards, they naturally tend towards a (relatively simple) strategy of maximizing damage output and minimizing damage taken. This can have variations like a tank build or a glass cannon build. Combat skills are focused on synergy with armor and weapons. Fighters will typically prioritize their health and stamina stats, but it would be feasible to incorporate spells in certain builds. Mostly fighters will rely on items and enchantments that don't cost magicka. The resource system and skill specialization restrictions disincentivize leaning too strongly into spells: more powerful spells are impractical to play without buffs to intelligence and magic schools which come mainly from mage skills.
  Thieves are more balanced between combat and magic and admit a wider variety of playstyles, though they may be more challenging for beginners. Thieves focus strongly on skill cards with a variety of effects, and have powerful synergies with illusion magic, so both stamina and magicka are useful. Thief decks focus on things like control and combos. Thieves' versatility is balanced by having access to neither powerful weapons and armor nor powerful spells.
  Mages are the most complex class. They focus on spell cards, which can do a wide variety of things. It's possible to replicate a more-or-less fighter build through destruction spells and shield spells. It's also possible to use alteration and illusion to control the game. Buffs from restoration spells and mage skills create powerful combos. One thing I want to incorporate is the biggest game exploit in Morrowind: in that game, fortify intelligence buffs the effectiveness of player-made potions, and potions can be made that fortify intelligence. This leads to a positive feedback loop whereby game-breaking, godlike powers are possible. My thought is to limit players' ability to actually exploit the game, but incorporate "looping" buffs like a spell buffing a skill that buffs a potion that buffs the original spell. This will need to be carefully balanced to make it a rare and satisfying occurrence for the player (and not the default strategy). These combos should, for example, take multiple turns to set up and looping over and over in the same battle should not be feasible. Mages are balanced by a few things: especially early on, damage output and damage reduction will be less than that of other classes; spells are more costly than equivalent cards that cost stamina, requiring mages to invest in magicka rather than health in order to be able to defeat enemies; in general, mages are the most vulnerable to single big-damage attacks and require more careful deckbuilding to be effective; damage output for a mage relies on specific combos much more than other classes.
  Regarding balancing, there are some effects and statuses that are "hate" (to use TCG lingo) for a particular class. Mages can do virtually nothing when silenced and are severely limited by damage intelligence. Frenzy, damage speed, and damage agility can prevent a thief from setting up combos or defenses. Blind, damage strength, and damage endurance can create openings to defeat a fighter. That being said, the player is not usually going to be facing a similar type of deck to the kind a player might have. Enemies, especially creatures, have abilities but may have access to completely different cards than the player and will typically have small, focused decks.
Card reward considerations
  A core part of Morrowind for me has always been going on a journey and getting gradually loaded down with items, eventually being barely able to make it back to down without being overencumbered. My goal is to replicate this, as well as the Slay the Spire card reward choice system, by making reward cards go straight into the deck. Deck size should be restrictive enough (like 40-50 cards maybe) that even entering a quest with the smallest possible deck means you will probably not be able to take all card rewards with you. This also disincentivizes collecting "merchant trash" as those cards will be in your deck taking up space until you get back to town. Cards that are not useful will only be picked up if they are particularly valuable, having that temporary trade-off. Once in town, cards can be sold or stored in the library.
Difficulty and replayability
  My goal is for the game to be relatively easy at first, much like the first couple battles in a new Slay the Spire run. As the player progresses, they have more options due to increased resource pools and newly acquired cards. While some builds will play a lot of cheap cards and other builds will play just one or two very costly cards per turn, the cost of newly acquired cards should be giving constant pressure to increase your resource pool (making the player make a tough choice between increasing health or one of the other resources). Note that cards will often be prohibitively costly, only becoming playable once the player reaches a high enough level. Later on in the game, costly cards can be played using buffs that increase resources or decrease costs (and in fact cost should outpace the player's ability to increase their stats, making these buffs a requirement for later levels). A player's specific build will be partly RNG based on card rewards and what appears in the merchant's shop. With a predetermined sequence of quests, there is no opportunity to grind low-level enemies for gold or experience. At multiple points in the game, there should be difficulty spikes that act as walls to further progression. Players get past these walls by improving their strategy, being luckier in the cards they get, and most importantly by accumulating cards in their class library (this makes a class-based progression system). Each run grants one card of the player choice added permanently to the class library, which is accessible from the beginning of the run alongside the player's library. At first, this could make a big difference from one run to the next, especially when particularly rare cards are acquired. On the other hand, having only a single copy of the card and (possibly) having to pay stamina or magicka to use it mean that having a single high level weapon for example in the class library won't trivialize the early game. Items and consumables are the obvious choice for cards to save, as they cost nothing and can be used from the very start of the game. This will have to be balanced against the challenge of acquiring truly good items and consumables. Another thing to note is that since buffs can make cards more powerful, they will naturally be somewhat weaker at low level (at least in some circumstances). On the other hand, acquiring a really rare and powerful card should feel genuinely rewarding-- something that boosts your overall progression in a meaningful way. My goal is for the player to *feel* more powerful as they progress.
  The "natural progression" of the game would be to start with the fighter, followed by the thief, followed by the mage, with replaying each of these classes multiple times. The goal is for these classes to be progressively more difficult and more fun/interesting to play.
Interacting statuses
  Statuses are meant to play off one another in interesting ways, with certain combinations of statuses being very powerful. The key is each status acting independently. So simultaneous fortify and damage strength has the effect of canceling each other out, one can be removed without affecting the other, for example to preserve the fortify effect. Every status can be stacked with every other status. For example, simultaneous frenzy and calm prevent the combatant from doing anything (they can play cards but the cards have no effect). There are certain things, however, which are difficult to affect through statuses and effects. For example, consumables can always be played regardless of status, and only in the case of frenzy and calm might their effects be negated (neither status alone negates all consumables). Consumables are often options of last resort, getting out just one effect per combat encounter. Status effects are not equally accessible and their accessibility varies by class as well. A fighter will rarely ever have an opportunity to apply a calm status, for example (probably only from a rare scroll). A thief might have a later-game skill that applies calm, and a mage might have a later-game spell that does. Fighters are virtually locked out of these options. On the other hand, the defense status is easy to get for all classes from the beginning of the game (though fighters get the most). Something like simultaneous calm and frenzy could only feasibly be accomplished by, say, a high-level mage focused on illusion spells, and it would still be a costly combo to pull off.

Setting and plot
The game takes place in the late 3rd Era in Vvardenfell (and possibly elsewhere in Morrowind) prior to the events of TES III. The political situation is similar to the start of that game. The player character comes to Morrowind for the guild work opportunities, previously being a simple bodyguard/mercenary, independent thief/vagabond, or mage's apprentice. Quests differ in flavor but are otherwise mostly similar between the different classes. A run culminates in a mission to a Sixth House citadel, with each class going there for a different reason. Events and characters should be inspired by Morrowind, but with little taken directly from the game (with the possible exception of reusing guild leader characters and major locations like cities and strongholds). Artistic license will be taken with things like caves and dwemer ruins, inventing new ones rather than reusing ones from the game.
Plot will be minimal, more to add context and flavor rather than being a compelling narrative. There will not be any meaningful plot-based choices or branching paths.
